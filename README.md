📘 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions. The goal of this repo is to:

Build strong problem-solving skills 💡
Develop a structured approach to coding challenges 🧩
Document my progress across different problem-solving patterns 📈

🛠️ Problem-Solving Approach

For each problem, I include:

Problem Statement (short summary or link)
Solution Code (Java implementation)
Explanation (comments in code)
Time & Space Complexity

🚀 Why This Repo?

To showcase problem-solving consistency.
To document my learning journey.
To help others looking for Java-based DSA solutions.
